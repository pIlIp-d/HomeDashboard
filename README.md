# HomeDashboard
A widget system for local web pages. 

Thanks to Michael Oesterreich for letting me contribute to his project.
He started the project and implemented the MySQL, the first php json handler, the recipe, bakingplan and odk_wfo.php.
The Dashboard was his idea and he figured out how to use the CSS grid.

The rest (except [these](#software-license-agreements)) is coded by me.
